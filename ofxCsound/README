Csound_001 is working but with resrictions:
- you cant include Csoudn lib into your project - that means you have to install it on the machine you want to run you app on..

------------------ Info: ------------------
ofxCsound is an extension to openframeworks - technically it is just a wrapper for the CsoundAPI -

------------------ Install: ------------------
1.) Currently you need to install Csound5 API on your computer first!
Download it here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/csound/files/

2.) put the ofxCsound_001 folder into of/addons/
3.) put the examples under of/addonsExamples/
4.) Done - try the examples.


------------------ Usage: ------------------
Changes to do, if you start with a blank OF-Xcode-Project:
	1. add existing Framework "CsoundLib.framework"
	2. go into compiler settings
	3. add under Linking->Symbol Ordering Flags: -l_csnd
	4. Done.



------------------ Notes: ------------------
Tests Done:
	- tested with Csound 5.12 with 32-Bit floats
	- tested multiple instances of csound in one project
	- running app on a system without csound installed -> failed lib.dylib not found

Todo:
	- include the CsoundLib.framework to skip csound installation
